# Just Jam

## Find your musical soulmates!

http://just-jam.herokuapp.com/

Just Jam is a web app that connects musicians looking to start a band together.

Users sign up and create their own profile, specifying what instrument they play, their favourite genres, their location, and little about themselves. 

Musicians looking to start a band or bands missing that important element can get in touch and organise a jam session.
