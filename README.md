# Just Jam

## Find your musical soulmates!

http://just-jam.herokuapp.com/

Just Jam is a web app that connects musicians looking to start a band together.

Users sign up and create their own profile, specifying what instrument they play, their favourite genres, their location, and little about themselves. Musicians looking to start a band or bands missing that important element can get in touch and organise a jam session.

Future features include:
 - Uploading audio & video clips to your profile, so prospective bandmates can hear (or see) you play.
 - An integrated messaging service built in to the app so all communication can be done in the same place.
 - Search filters for musicians who play more than one instrument.
 - A location-based filter.

## Built With

 - Node.js
 - MongoDB
 - JavaScript
 - Pug, SCSS & Bootstrap

### Testing

 - Mocha
 - Zombie.js
