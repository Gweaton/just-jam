# Just Jam

#### Find your musical soulmates!

![alt tag](public/images/screenshot.png)

Just Jam is a mobile responsive web app that connects musicians looking to start a band together.

Users can sign up, create their own profile and upload sound clips of themselves. They can then search for other users and if they like what they hear can start a chat and organise a jam session.

Use it on Heroku [here](http://just-jam.herokuapp.com/).

Just Jam was built by [George Eaton](https://github.com/gweaton), [Chris Cooper](https://github.com/cjcoops), [Jenna Ramdenee]( https://github.com/jennaramdenee) and [Rory Grieve](https://github.com/rorygrieve) in 8 days as our final project at Makers Academy.
